How to build with <b>Visual Studio 17 2022</b> on Windows:
<p/>
<ul>
<li/> Update the "setup_windows_env.bat" file with proper values for your build environment.
<li/> Use "cmd.exe" to execute "setup_windows_env.bat", then
<li/> mkdir build
<li/> cd build
<li/> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
<li/> It will create many files, among which Ods2.sln (if built for Visual Studio).
<li/> Open Ods2.sln using Visual Studio
<li/> Build all in Release Mode.
<li/> The library output is in $Ods2/build/lib, possibly in a "Release" or "Debug" subfolder.
<li/> The needed files are ods.dll, z.dll (zlib) and zip.dll
<li/> "examples" will create an .exe file in $Ods2/build/examples
</ul> On the screenshot one can see what the "examples" (built as "app.exe")
together with all needed .dll files looks like.<br/>
The "platforms" folder contains "qwindows(d).dll"

How to build with <b>LLVM MinGW</b> on Windows 10/11:
<p/>
<ul>
<li/> Update the "setup_windows_env.bat" file with proper values for your build environment.
<li/> Use "cmd.exe" to execute "setup_windows_env.bat", then
<li/> mkdir build
<li/> cd build
<li/> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
<li/> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
<li> Install "make" on windows (if you didn't already):
On windows 10 or 11, you can run the command <pre>"winget install ezwinports.make"</pre> in the
command line or powershell to quickly install it, then restart the command line or powershell.
Now you can run "make"!
<li/> make -j4
</ul>
